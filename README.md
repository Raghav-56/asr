# Speech Recognition with Hugging Face

This function uses the Hugging Face API to perform speech recognition. It takes an audio file from Appwrite storage and sends it to the Hugging Face API for speech recognition. The API returns the text and records it in the database. This function also supports receiving document events from the Appwrite Database.

### APPWRITE_FUNCTION_PROJECT_ID / APPWRITE_FUNCTION_API_ENDPOINT

These are provided to the function runtime automatically in Appwrite functions. You don't usually need to set them manually.

### For the local test UI (index.html)

Create a `ui-config.json` (ignored by git) next to `index.html` with:

```json
{
  "endpoint": "https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1",
  "projectId": "<your-project-id>",
  "bucketId": "speech_recognition",
  "appwriteApiKey": "<scoped-key-with-Storage.createFile>",
  "functionUrl": "<your-function-url>",
  "functionKey": "<scoped-key-used-by-function>"
}
```

Notes:

- The browser page is for testing only. Do not expose admin keys. Use a minimal, time-limited API key with only Storage createFile permission to the chosen bucket.
- Ensure CORS in Appwrite project allows the origin where you open the page.
- Bucket ID in the UI should match `APPWRITE_BUCKET_ID` used by the function (defaults differ otherwise).

## Where to get values

- Hugging Face access token: Hugging Face Settings ‚Üí Access Tokens.
- Appwrite endpoint: Cloud instance is `https://cloud.appwrite.io/v1` or your self-hosted URL.
- Project ID: Appwrite Console ‚Üí Your Project ‚Üí Settings.
- Bucket ID: Appwrite Console ‚Üí Storage ‚Üí Your bucket.
- Database/Collection IDs: Appwrite Console ‚Üí Databases ‚Üí IDs you configured.
- Function URL: Appwrite Console ‚Üí Functions ‚Üí Your function ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Function URL.
- Scoped API keys: Appwrite Console ‚Üí API Keys ‚Üí Create; scope to Storage (createFile on your bucket) for the UI, and broader as needed for the function.
